Dozenal Minecraft
=================

A crazy experiment of integrating dozenal support into Minecraft.

What is Dozenal?
----------------

Dozenal is one of the popularised names for a positional number system using twelve
as the base. Proponents of the dozenal system claim that it is superior to decimal
because many common fractions are more neatly represented in dozenal.

For example:

* 1/3 = 0.4
* 1/4 = 0.3
* 1/5 = 0.24972497...
* 1/6 = 0.2

For this project I intend to use the Unicode ↊ for ten/dec and ↋ for eleven/el,
though with slightly modified glyphs to fit the artwork I use elsewhere.


Getting it Running
------------------

Now no longer requires customising the Java install.
If you customised your Java install for the previous versions, it should do no harm,
since we're not setting the custom locale anymore either.

1. Install [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/)
2. Fetch and build [the dozenal mod](https://github.com/ephemeral-laboratories/dozenal-mod)
   (This step will get easier in the future)
3. In MultiMC, Add Instance, create a new Minecraft 1.16.3 instance on latest working
   version of Forge
4. Add the dozenal mod jar as a "loader mod"
5. Add whatever other mods you want, and you're done

My own pack will eventually have other mods which are being tracked
[on Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sh5RcOECH2EJV4eUeANybXl3Mpj6RwGJvizY_Tls07E/edit#gid=0)

This repository will remain as the place to release packs but I currently have
no automated process for doing so.
